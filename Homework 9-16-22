# The grey matter tau burden in this paper (Figures 2 adn 3) was log transformed to fit a normal distribution.  
#The authors could then use a linear mixed effects model to analyze the tau burden across diagnosis groups and isoforms.

exampe of log transforming data
df <- c(1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,6,7,8,8,9,10)
hist(df)

log_df <- log10(df)
hist(log_df)
#While the log transformation is not a perfectly normal distribution, it does normalize the data.
#Then the lme packages can be used to run linear mixed effects models.
